# Introduction
This repository contains logic locked benchmarks that are being locked using sequential obfuscation technique. `If you use the benchmarks for your reseach, please refer to [1]`.

# Structure of the repo
./benchmarks/*  --> Obfuscated versions of gate-level netlists of MIT CEP IPs [2].

./lib/*         --> Standard cell library files.
